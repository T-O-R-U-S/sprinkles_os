# SprinklesOS

## A hobby operating system

### Pre-requisites

- Cargo
- Qemu (optional, for testing)

### Running

All you have to do is clone this repo, install Qemu, and `cargo run` to boot into Sprinkles.

### TODOs

- A Nice TUI
- Text editor
- Hand-written allocator(?)
  - Currently, the `linked_list_allocator` crate does all that I need, presenting little reason to re-write it.
